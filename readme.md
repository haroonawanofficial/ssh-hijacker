# SSH Hijacker 

Silent SSH hijacker. It intercepts and logs SSH handshakes, silently relays traffic, and supports advanced stealth techniques such as MAC spoofing and invisible network presence.

---

## Features

- Full SSH interceptor with banner 
- `--invisible` mode: hides attacker IP from network logs  
- `--macspoof`: randomizes attacker MAC address  
- Automatically restores all system settings on exit  
- Invisible to Wireshark and other packet analyzers using `--invisible`  
- Attacker IP is untraceable even with forensic tools  
- Does not break encryption â€” it outplays it  
- Do **not** use this unless you fully understand what you're doing
