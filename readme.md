# SSH Hijacker â€” Interceptor

A silent SSH hijacker that operates and outplays encryption. It intercepts and logs SSH handshakes, relays traffic silently, and supports stealth techniques like MAC spoofing and invisible network presence.


## ðŸš€ Features

- SSH interceptor with full banner relay
- Works with encryption phase 
- `--invisible` mode: hides attacker in network using `iptables`
- `--macspoof`: randomizes attacker MAC address
- Auto restores system settings on exit
- Wireshark and other tcp dumper can not see attacker ip using ivisible mode
- attacker ip is not traceable even with forensic tool using invisible mode
